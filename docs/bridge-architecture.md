# Generic Token Bridge Interface Architecture

This document describes the design and implementation of the Generic Token Bridge Interface for cross-chain wrap interactions in `stellar-wrap-contract`.

## Overview

The Generic Token Bridge Interface allows `stellar-wrap-contract` to interact seamlessly with external blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, Solana). It enables users to transfer/bridge wrap records off-chain to target chains and allows authorized bridge relayers to process inbound cross-chain wrap transfers onto Stellar.

## Key Components & Workflow

### 1. Administration & Network Registry

- **Bridge Relayer (`set_bridge_relayer` / `get_bridge_relayer`)**:
  - The admin configures an authorized relayer or bridge validator contract.
  - Inbound bridge operations require explicit authorization (`relayer.require_auth()`).

- **Supported Chain Registry (`set_chain_status` / `is_chain_supported`)**:
  - Chains are identified by unique numeric network IDs (e.g., `1` for Ethereum Mainnet, `137` for Polygon, `900` for Solana).
  - Outbound and inbound bridge operations verify that target/source chains are active before proceeding.

### 2. Outbound Cross-Chain Wrap (`bridge_wrap_out`)

1. **Initiation**: A user calls `bridge_wrap_out(user, destination_chain, recipient_address, period)`.
2. **Validation**:
   - Contract must not be paused.
   - User must authorize the transaction (`user.require_auth()`).
   - Destination chain ID must be enabled.
   - Recipient address payload must be non-empty.
3. **State Transition**:
   - The user's local wrap record transitions from `Active` to terminal `Bridged` using the Wrap Lifecycle FSM.
   - `Bridged` records cannot be transferred, burned, re-bridged, or reactivated by the user.
4. **Nonce & Storage**:
   - Monotonically increasing `OutboundBridgeNonce` counter is incremented.
   - An `OutboundBridgeRequest` record is written to persistent storage.
5. **Event Emission**: Emits `br_out` event containing user, destination chain, nonce, recipient address, and wrap period.

### 3a. Outbound Refund

- If the destination chain rejects an outbound request, the configured bridge
   relayer calls `bridge_wrap_refund(outbound_nonce)`.
- The request must identify an existing `Bridged` record; the relayer restores
   it to `Active` and the contract emits `br_refund`.
- The public `transition_wrap_state` entry point cannot exit `Bridged`, so only
   this relayer-authorized settlement path can unlock the wrap.

### 3. Inbound Cross-Chain Wrap (`bridge_wrap_in`)

1. **Relayer Execution**: An authorized bridge relayer calls `bridge_wrap_in(source_chain, source_nonce, recipient, period, archetype, data_hash)`.
2. **Validation & Replay Protection**:
   - Relayer authorization is verified (`relayer.require_auth()`).
   - Source chain must be active.
   - `InboundBridgeProcessed(source_chain, source_nonce)` ensures each cross-chain transaction can only be processed once (preventing double-spend / replay attacks).
3. **Wrap Minting / Activation**:
   - Validates period structure (`YYYYMM` format, between `MIN_PERIOD_YEAR = 2024` and `MAX_PERIOD_YEAR = 2100` with months `01..=12`, enforced by shared `validate_period`).
   - If wrap record does not exist on Stellar, creates a new active wrap record for `recipient` and updates wrap counts and latest period metadata.
    - If wrap record already exists, transitions state to `Active` through the
       FSM; illegal transitions fail with `InvalidStateTransition`.
4. **Record & Event**:
   - Stores `InboundBridgeRecord(source_chain, source_nonce)` in persistent storage.
   - Emits `br_in` event with recipient address, source chain, source nonce, and period.

## Data Structures & Storage Keys

### Data Types

```rust
pub struct OutboundBridgeRequest {
    pub nonce: u64,
    pub sender: Address,
    pub destination_chain: u32,
    pub recipient_address: Bytes,
    pub period: u64,
    pub archetype: Symbol,
    pub data_hash: BytesN<32>,
    pub timestamp: u64,
}

pub struct InboundBridgeRecord {
    pub source_chain: u32,
    pub source_nonce: u64,
    pub recipient: Address,
    pub period: u64,
    pub archetype: Symbol,
    pub data_hash: BytesN<32>,
    pub timestamp: u64,
}
```

### Storage Keys (`DataKey`)

- `BridgeRelayer`: Configured relayer `Address`.
- `BridgeChainStatus(u32)`: Status flag (`bool`) per chain ID.
- `OutboundBridgeNonce`: Monotonic counter (`u64`).
- `OutboundBridgeRequest(u64)`: Outbound request keyed by nonce.
- `InboundBridgeProcessed(u32, u64)`: Replay flag keyed by `(source_chain, source_nonce)`.
- `InboundBridgeRecord(u32, u64)`: Inbound record keyed by `(source_chain, source_nonce)`.

## Security Audit & Guarantees

1. **Replay Protection**: Inbound nonces are recorded per source chain in persistent storage to prevent replay attacks.
2. **Access Control**: Admin authorization is enforced for configuration (`set_bridge_relayer`, `set_chain_status`), and Relayer authorization is enforced for inbound wraps.
3. **Emergency Pause**: Main contract pause flag immediately halts both outbound and inbound bridge operations.
4. **Storage TTL Management**: Persistent entries (outbound requests, inbound records, processed flags) have TTL set to 1 year (~17,280 * 365 ledgers).

## Decision Records

The bridge contract's security posture is governed by two architecture decision
records. They are filed under `docs/` alongside this document and are linked
here so a reader finds them in context:

- [`docs/PROXY_PATTERN_DECISION.md`](./PROXY_PATTERN_DECISION.md) — the proxy
  pattern decision. It records that the bridge does **not** use a batching
  proxy contract (issue #517); each bridge entry point is called directly and
  authorization is enforced per call. This decision is enforced by the
  `proxy_pattern_decision` test module, which fails if a batching proxy entry
  point is introduced without updating the record.
- [`docs/SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION_DECISION.md`](./SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION_DECISION.md)
  — the signature verification decision. It records that inbound bridge
  operations are authorized by `require_auth()` on the configured relayer
  rather than by off-chain signatures. This decision is enforced by the
  `signature_verification_decision` test module, which fails if a signature
  verification path is added without updating the record.

Both records carry a review checklist item (see the "Enforcement" section of
each record) so a reviewer can catch a violation during code review even
before the executable test runs.

## Bridge Architecture and Authority Model

This section describes how cross-chain messages are relayed into the contract and how the bridge relayer fits into the contract's overall authority model.

### Relayers

Bridge relayers submit signed cross-chain messages. A relayer is a privileged actor: it can trigger any action that the bridge is authorized to perform on the destination chain. Relayers are registered and removed by the admin (see `docs/admin-rotation.md`).

### Authority Model

Privileged actions in this contract are reachable through more than one route. The routes are:

1. **Admin direct** — the admin calls the privileged function directly. No delay. The admin can cancel any pending governance or timelock action.
2. **Governance proposal** — token holders propose and vote; on success the action is queued. Delay is the governance voting period plus the timelock delay. The admin or governance can cancel a queued proposal before execution.
3. **Timelock** — a queued action executes after the timelock delay elapses. The admin can cancel a queued action before it executes. See `docs/timelock.md`.
4. **Bridge relayer** — a registered relayer submits a signed message that triggers the action. No delay beyond message finality. The admin can deregister a relayer, which prevents future messages but does not cancel an already-submitted message.

### Fastest path per action

The fastest path to any privileged action is the one with the smallest delay, not the largest. For most actions the admin direct route is fastest (no delay). For actions the admin cannot perform directly, the bridge relayer route is fastest (message finality only). The governance and timelock routes are always slower because they include a voting period and/or a timelock delay.

### Actions reachable by multiple routes

Any action reachable by both the admin direct route and the governance/timelock route has different guarantees depending on the route: the admin route is immediate and cancellable only by the admin, while the governance route is delayed and cancellable by the admin or governance. Any action reachable by both the bridge relayer route and the admin route is subject to the relayer's signing authority in addition to the admin's authority; the admin can revoke the relayer but cannot retroactively cancel a message the relayer already submitted.

### Privileged Actions

Each privileged function in the contract appears exactly once below, with all of its routes.

| Privileged action | Admin direct | Governance proposal | Timelock | Bridge relayer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `setAdmin` | yes (no delay) | yes (vote + timelock) | yes (timelock delay) | no |
| `setRelayer` | yes (no delay) | yes (vote + timelock) | yes (timelock delay) | no |
| `setTimelockDelay` | yes (no delay) | yes (vote + timelock) | yes (timelock delay) | no |
| `pause` | yes (no delay) | yes (vote + timelock) | yes (timelock delay) | yes (message finality) |
| `unpause` | yes (no delay) | yes (vote + timelock) | yes (timelock delay) | yes (message finality) |
| `upgrade` | yes (no delay) | yes (vote + timelock) | yes (timelock delay) | no |
| `withdraw` | yes (no delay) | yes (vote + timelock) | yes (timelock delay) | yes (message finality) |

### Who may initiate, delay, and cancel

- **Admin direct:** initiated by the admin; no delay; cancellable only by the admin (by not calling it).
- **Governance proposal:** initiated by any token holder meeting the proposal threshold; delay is the voting period plus the timelock delay; cancellable by the admin or by governance before execution.
- **Timelock:** initiated by the admin or by a passed governance proposal; delay is the timelock delay; cancellable by the admin before execution.
- **Bridge relayer:** initiated by a registered relayer; delay is message finality only; cancellable by the admin only by deregistering the relayer, which does not affect already-submitted messages.
